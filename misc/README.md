# Misc files required but not provided in this repo

The only file you need to obtain to make this project work (apart of the toolchain, e.g. LLVM + clang):

1. `smb1-us.nes`: somehow find an `.nes`-format ROM for the game.
   I'm using a ROM file which has an MD5 hash of:
   `811b027eaf99c2def7b933c5208636de`

Other files which are automatically generated:

2. `smbdis.asm`: this entire project is made possible
   by `doppelganger`'s reverse-engineering work, which
   can be found at https://gist.githubusercontent.com/1wErt3r/4048722/raw/59e88c0028a58c6d7b9156749230ccac647bc7d4/SMBDIS.ASM .
   The `Makefile` will automatically fetch this.
   Tools under `utils` will process this file and mechanically break it up into "C++ but still emulated" code blocks.
3. `chrrom.h`, and:
4. `chrrom.cc`: these are automatically generated by
    tools in the `utils` directory
    (assuming you obtained a ROM, see #1)
